This is the case study for migrating from Angular 1.

The process of migrating involves a number of steps.

1. Style guide
1. TypeScript & build tools
1. AngularJS 1.5+
1. Component’ify
1. ES6’ify
1. Dual Boot
1. Services to Angular 
1. Components to Angular
1. Routing to Angular
1. Remove AngularJS

Each step is described by a set of branches in the code.

The best way to understand is to compare each branch to the previous to see what code was changed.
